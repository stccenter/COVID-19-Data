# US Policy Dataset
## Policy Data Description 
The Government Response Stringency Index is first introduced by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT; Hale et al, 2020). It is an indicator of governments’ responsiveness to the crisis of COVID-19 and the extent of lockdown in the specific region on a scale from 0 to 100. This index is used to graph the temporal dynamic policy change for both global and US in our research. The Response Stringency Index includes seven categories of policy such as school closure, business closure, public event cancellation, etc., as well as a generalization code to indicate the scope of the policy. The calculation of the index includes several steps. First, code the qualitative policy into quantitative numbers (0,1,2,3) according to the extent and national/regional coverage of the specific policy. Then the code numbers of each category of policy are rescaled to create a score between 0 to 100. Then the seven scores are averaged to get the overall Stringency Index for that region. 

The data are gleaned from each state’s COVID-19 website and executive orders that announce related policy and well-known news website (e.g. CNN). The collection of these policy mainly follows the categories organized by Hale et al. (2020), and only policy that falls under these categories (e.g. school closure), or policy that has a great impact on people’s life under COVID-19 (e.g. monetary assistance towards local business) are collected. Therefore, people who would like to use this dataset need to be cautious that the Index only includes these 7 categories of policy in the document and other policy types were not taken into consideration.

Similar to our dataset here, articles as Elgin, Basbug & Yalaman (2020), Piguillem & Shi (2020) and La et al (2020) all have examined governmental policy responses to COVID-19, but they all have different foci. Elgin, Basbug & Yalaman (2020) investigated economic policy responses adopted by 166 countries and calculated the COVID-19 economic stimulus index which is very similar to ours but with the emphasis of economic reactions. Piguillem & Shi (2020), on the other hand, looked at the effectiveness of governmental quarantine and testing policies. Lastly, La et al (2020) focused on policy response to COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam in particular, but besides policy this paper also collected socioeconomic data such as social media and science journalism. Therefore, we can see that researchers around the world have already become aware of the importance of various policy and economic responses and their effect on various societal outcomes.

Collecting governmental policy data not only informs us about the actions that each government takes, but also enables us to conduct studies and analyses on its effectiveness and influence. Government’s responsive policy is directly related to the spread of COVID-19. The combination of constructive policies and practical implementation can effectively stop the spread of virus. For example, school and business closure and public events cancellation helped China control the situation successfully. Also, public information campaign at early stage can raise public’s awareness of the pandemic and inform them of the actions that can be taken to protect them from being infected. Additionally, policies restricting national and international travel can help countries that haven’t had COVID-19 to stem its spread from the beginning. Overall speaking, policies and executive orders issued by governments are necessary to inform and unite the whole public together to combat the current crisis of COVID-19.
